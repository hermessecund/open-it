Spaces in open spaces are organized storage buckets that utilize IPFS, a blockchain implemetation for storage.
Resources in spaces are arranged based on concepts and topics making them easier to find...

Public spaces are accesible to anyone with a link and appear in search results, while external access to private spaces are strictly on invitation.
